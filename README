POW - Simple laptop power management.

This program has two commands, 'pow bat' for swapping to
battery mode and 'pow pow' for swapping to power (or AC)
mode.

How exactly this utility runs is up to you, the user.
All this program does is provide the switching mechanism.

All powertop tunables passed in testing on my machine.
There may be missing rules for hardware I do not own.
Please open an issue with powertop output and I'll add
support.

There is no configuration file. Simply edit the program
to enable/disable the functionality you require.
It's tiny in size.
